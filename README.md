# Temperature_altert_agent_project

**Description of project :**
This Python code is designed to send temperature alerts via SMS using Twilio based on certain temperature thresholds. Here's a breakdown of what it does in an understandable form:

1. Import necessary libraries:
   - requests: For making HTTP requests to a weather API.
   - twilio.rest.Client: For interacting with the Twilio SMS service.
   - uAgent: It appears to be a custom module or class for scheduling and running periodic tasks.

2. Configure your API and Twilio credentials:
   - You need to replace placeholders with your actual API keys, Twilio credentials, and phone numbers.
   - You'll also input the user's phone number and the location for which you want to monitor the weather.
   - Set minimum and maximum temperature thresholds.

3. Initialize the Twilio client:
   - This creates a connection to the Twilio service using your credentials.

4. Create a function to fetch current temperature:
   - It sends an HTTP request to a weather API (which should be specified as 'YOUR_TWILIO_WEATHER_URL') and retrieves the current temperature for the provided location.

5. Create a function to check and send temperature alerts:
   - This function gets the current temperature and checks it against the specified minimum and maximum thresholds.
   - If the temperature falls below the minimum, it sends a message to bundle up.
   - If the temperature exceeds the maximum, it sends a message to stay cool.

6. Create a function to send SMS alerts:
   - This function utilizes the Twilio client to send an SMS alert to the user's phone number.

7. Create a repeating agent for temperature alerts:
   - An agent is created using 'uAgent,' and it's scheduled to run the 'check_temperature_and_send_alert' function every 30 minutes.

8. Start the agent:
   - The agent is started, which means it will periodically check the weather conditions and send SMS alerts if the temperature goes outside the specified thresholds.

This code is essentially a weather monitoring system that uses Twilio to send temperature alerts to a user's phone when the weather conditions don't meet the defined temperature criteria. However, there are some placeholders in the code that need to be filled in with actual API URLs and credentials for it to work correctly.

**Instructions to run the project:**
To run this project, follow these instructions in simple terms:

1. *Install Required Libraries:*
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
   - Install the necessary libraries by running:
     
     pip install requests twilio
     

2. *Get API Keys and Credentials:*
   - Obtain your weather API key and Twilio account credentials.
   - Replace the placeholders in the code with your actual API key, Twilio credentials, and phone numbers.

3. *Run the Code:*
   - Open a text editor (like Notepad or VSCode) and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., temperature_alert.py).

4. *Configure Location and Temperature Thresholds:*
   - When you run the code, it will ask you for:
     - Your phone number (for receiving alerts).
     - The location (city/country) for which you want weather data.
     - Minimum and maximum temperature thresholds.

5. *Start the Program:*
   - Save the file and run it using:
     
     python temperature_alert.py
     

6. *Let it Run:*
   - The program will start and create a repeating agent.
   - It will periodically check the weather conditions for your specified location.
   - If the temperature goes outside the defined thresholds, it will send you an SMS alert via Twilio.

Remember to keep the code running for it to continuously monitor the weather and send alerts as needed.


**Special consideration:**
There are some special considerations you should keep in mind when running this program:

1. *API Usage and Cost:* Depending on the weather API you're using, there may be usage limits and potential costs associated with making API requests. Be aware of these limitations and any associated fees.

2. *API Endpoint URL:* Ensure that you specify the correct weather API endpoint URL in the code. The URL should provide the current weather data for the location you're interested in. Verify the API documentation for the correct URL format.

3. *API Key Security:* Protect your API keys and credentials. Do not share them publicly or store them in your code repository. Use environment variables or a secure configuration method to store sensitive information.

4. *Twilio Account Balance:* To send SMS alerts with Twilio, you need to have a positive balance in your Twilio account. Ensure you have enough funds to cover the SMS messages you plan to send.

5. *Location Format:* Ensure that the 'location' input is in the correct format (e.g., 'New York,US'). Check the weather API documentation for supported location formats.

6. *Temperature Thresholds:* Set appropriate minimum and maximum temperature thresholds for your specific needs. Make sure these values are in the correct temperature scale (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit) as per the API's response.

7. *Scheduling Frequency:* The code schedules the temperature check every 30 minutes by default (30 * 60 seconds). Adjust this frequency if needed, but be mindful of API rate limits and potential costs associated with frequent requests.

8. *Keep the Program Running:* To receive continuous temperature alerts, keep the Python script running on your computer or a server. Consider running it as a background process or using a tool like nohup or screen to ensure it runs uninterrupted.

9. *Error Handling:* Implement proper error handling to deal with issues like network errors, API request failures, or incorrect input values.

10. *Testing:* Before relying on the program for critical alerts, thoroughly test it to ensure it behaves as expected. Check if alerts are sent correctly when temperature conditions are met.

11. *Privacy:* Be mindful of privacy regulations and user consent when collecting and using phone numbers for sending SMS alerts.

12. *Updates and Maintenance:* Keep your API keys and dependencies up to date. APIs and libraries may change over time, and it's important to adapt your code accordingly.

By considering these points, you can run the program effectively and ensure that it functions reliably in your weather monitoring and alert system.
